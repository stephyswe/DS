# Dark Souls Interactive Map - http://darksoulsmap.ga/
- A tribute to three designers, an eye-catching vector-based background of Lordran viewed by 40 thousands people on Kotaku, as well as two figure models (vector and bitmap)

A Success Story ( https://twitter.com/tettix/status/843910740796956672 ) made on behalf of tettix, the founder of Lordran Map, (which took 3 months to complete) to make a visual representation of his worldview combined with enemies and characters created by digitalcleo and servantofentropy. Click any characters provides more in-depth details about their origin and Dark Souls Lore. Website can be viewed in Vector or Pixel mode (top-right corner), 'clicking' on the Sun changed between Day-night cycle. Some extra easter eggs. A chat message box was implemented but removed due to request by client. 

## Techniques used
Colorbox.js, Jquery, Minimap.js, ios.orientationchange.fix, rwdImageMaps.js. And a big ladle to mix it all togather! :)
